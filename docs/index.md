# About voluba-mriwarp

> **Note: _voluba-mriwarp_ is still in development. You may still encounter bugs when using it.**

VoluBA (**Volu**metric **B**rain **A**nchoring) offers tools to connect volumetric imaging data to multilevel atlases and in this way makes it accessible for analysis with the siibra toolsuite.

_voluba-mriwarp_ is a desktop application that integrates whole brain T1-weighted MRI scans into the anatomical context of the [Julich Brain Atlas](https://julich-brain-atlas.de/). It incorporates all required components like skull stripping, registration to [ICBM MNI152 2009c nonlinear asymmetric space](https://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009), and detailed analysis with the siibra toolsuite. The corresponding functionalities are provided via open-source tools like [HD-BET](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/HD-BET)[^1], [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) and [siibra-python](https://github.com/FZJ-INM1-BDA/siibra-python). _voluba-mriwarp_ is primarily designed for Windows 10 but can also be executed on Linux.

Warping brain data to a standardized space like MNI152 enables anchoring of whole brain MRI scans to atlas volumes like [BigBrain](https://julich-brain-atlas.de/atlas/bigbrain). However, reasonable registration requires various steps that need optimization effort. _voluba-mriwarp_ aims to simplify this workflow. With this application, you avoid installing multiple tools and tweaking parameters for a proper registration result. Instead, _voluba-mriwarp_ is an easy-to-install and easy-to-use tool combining all necessary steps into one pipeline.

<p class="admonition-title">Your data remains on your computer</p>
<p>We designed <em>voluba-mriwarp</em> as a desktop application. Therefore, the input MRI dataset will not be uploaded to any online services. It remains only on your local computer.</p>

_voluba-mriwarp_ applies a set of predefined parameters to remove the skull and warp the input brain scan to MNI152 space. You can utilize the warping results in _voluba-mriwarp_ to interactively assign brain regions to a point in the input space. Select a location in the displayed brain of a subject to perform a probabilistic assignment using Julich-Brain Cytoarchitectonic Maps 2.9. Hence, you can estimate the probability of a brain region occurring at the selected point. To explore even more information about a cytoarchitectonic area, you can access [siibra-explorer](https://atlases.ebrains.eu/viewer/human) through the application.
